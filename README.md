# ASME_2025_WEBSITE
I am LOCKED IN




A lot of the asme website is a huge hodgepodge of code from ages and ages ago with help from several people, GPTs, and search engines. 
This is the lates 2025 iteration of ASME's website -- I hope it works out!! I will put the HTML in here (both old and updated -- at some point they will be the same thing because I'll give up).

I do not know HTML whatsoever at all.
